# Rubymotion::Graphics

Not yet a gem. Working on it.

A port of Hotcocoa Graphics / MacRuby Graphics to be used with RubyMotion. See MacRuby Graphics Info here: https://github.com/mattetti/macruby_graphics and here
http://github.com/drtoast/macruby_graphics

To run the examples uncomment them one by one in the app_delegate and then build.

A description of how they are supposed to look can be found at dr.toast's site: http://hcg.drtoast.com

Enjoy!
